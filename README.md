Slider Trinkey Brightness Controller for Linux
This repository contains the necessary scripts to use an Adafruit Slider Trinkey as a hardware monitor brightness controller on a Linux machine. It consists of two main parts:

CircuitPython Script: This code runs on the Slider Trinkey itself. It reads the position of the potentiometer slider and prints the value to the serial port.

Host Python Script: This script runs on your Linux PC. It listens to the serial output from the Slider Trinkey and uses the brightnessctl command-line utility to adjust your monitor's brightness.

ðŸ’» Setup and Usage
Step 1: Prepare the Adafruit Slider Trinkey
First, you need to ensure the Slider Trinkey is running the provided CircuitPython code.

Install CircuitPython: Follow the official Adafruit guide to get CircuitPython running on your device.

Upload trinkeycode.py: Copy the trinkeycode.py script onto your Slider Trinkey's CIRCUITPY drive. This script reads the potentiometer's value and prints it to the serial console.

Step 2: Prepare Your Linux Machine
Next, you'll set up your Linux machine to read from the Slider Trinkey and control the brightness.

Install Dependencies: You'll need python3, pip, and the brightnessctl utility. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can install them with the following command:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip brightnessctl

Install Python Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries for serial communication.

pip3 install pyserial

Download the Host Script: Save the ctlbright.py script to your computer.

Run the Script: Connect your Slider Trinkey to a USB port. Run the host script with sudo to ensure it has the necessary permissions to control brightness.

sudo python3 ctlbright.py

The script will print the current brightness and then automatically adjust the brightness as you move the slider on the trinkey.

ðŸŽ¬ Demonstration
A video demonstrating the functionality of the Slider Trinkey brightness controller can be added here.

ðŸ“„ Code Reference
trinkeycode.py (CircuitPython for Slider Trinkey)
This script maps the analog input from the potentiometer to a 0-100 value and prints it to the serial port.
